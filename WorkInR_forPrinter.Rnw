% Use of R object inline
In the Table \ref{summaryNumeric}, you realize that the mean of HDI is {\bf\Sexpr{round(mean(mergedData$HumanDevelopmentIndex),2)}}. It would be good to see a boxplot, check Figure \ref{numBoxplot} below.

DataForBox=reshape2::melt(mergedData[,scaledNumeric])

base=ggplot(data=DataForBox)

                        fill='lightblue',

%%%%% A citation: author(year)
Boxplots were introduced by \citet{tukey_exploratory_1977}. You can also flip the Table \ref{summaryNumeric}, as shown in Table \ref{summaryNumeric-flip}.

stargazer(mergedData[,originalNumeric],

\section{My Regression}\label{regre}

Several times we need regression. This is a nice summary for two regressions, as shown in Table \ref{regs1}:

<<regresPrep, echo=FALSE>>=
## prepare regressions
h1=formula(HumanDevelopmentIndex~Functioningofgovernment)
regre1=glm(h1,data=mergedData,family = "gaussian")

h2=formula(HumanDevelopmentIndex~Functioningofgovernment + Politicalparticipation)
regre2=glm(h2,data=mergedData,family = "gaussian")
@





<<regs1, echo=FALSE,results=tex>>=
## show result of both BETTER
stargazer(regre1,regre2,
          title = "Models for HDI",
          dep.var.labels   = "Human Development",
          covariate.labels = c("Bureaucracy", "Participation"),
          label = 'regs1')
@

I hope you like what you see in the Table \ref{regs1}. You can learn more on regression in 
other book \citep[150-160]{petrie_introduction_2016}
