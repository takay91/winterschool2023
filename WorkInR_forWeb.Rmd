You can see the statistics of categorical variables in Table \@ref(tab:catexploreTable).

<!--the chunk name  IS USED in cross-ref for TABLES, SEE above-->

<!-- Table is created and displayed. -->

```{r catexploreTable,results='asis', warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## display frequency table of Regime type
library(summarytools)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

namesHeaders=c("Democracy Level","count","pct","pct_cumm")
freq(mergedData$Regimetype, 
     plain.ascii = FALSE,
     report.nas=FALSE) %>%
    ## changes, we need data frame
    tb() %>% 
     kable(format = "html", 
           digits = 2,
           caption = "This is a table",
           col.names = namesHeaders)%>%
     kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

You can see this variable plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:catBarplot) below.

<!-- Object 'bar' will be created and plotted -->

<!--the chunk name is used to cross-ref the figure in 'bar'-->

<!--Figure caption (fig.cap) in chunk header is a MUST-->

```{r catBarplot, fig.cap="Freedom of Press in the world",echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

base=ggplot(data = mergedData)
bar=base + geom_bar(aes(x=Regimetype),
                    fill='orange',
                    color='red')
bar=bar + labs(title = "Democracy in the world (2021)",
           x= "Levels",
           y= "Count of countries",
           caption = 'Source: The Economist')

```{r summaryNumeric, results='asis', message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
## table of summary statistics for numerical columns
AllNumericNames=names(Filter(is.numeric, mergedData))
originalNumeric=AllNumericNames[!grepl('mM',AllNumericNames)]

library(vtable)
st(mergedData[,originalNumeric],
   title ="Stats summary for numeric vars",
   digits = 1) #decimal places
```

<!-- Use of R object inline -->

In the Table \@ref(tab:summaryNumeric), you see that the mean of HDI is **`r mean(mergedData$HumanDevelopmentIndex)`**.

It would be good to see a boxplot with the re scaled values, check Figure \@ref(fig:numBoxplot) below.

```{r numBoxplot,fig.cap='The nice boxplots' ,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
scaledNumeric=AllNumericNames[grepl('mM',AllNumericNames)]

DataForBox=reshape2::melt(mergedData[,scaledNumeric])

base=ggplot(data=DataForBox)
box=base + geom_boxplot(aes(x=variable,y=value),
                        fill='lightblue',
                        color='red') + coord_flip()
## plotting
box
```

The boxplots you have just seen were introduced by [@tukey_exploratory_1977].

# My Regression

Several times we need regression. This is a nice summary for two regressions, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:regs1):

```{r regresPrep, echo=FALSE}
## prepare regressions
h1=formula(HumanDevelopmentIndex~Functioningofgovernment)
regre1=glm(h1,data=mergedData,family = "gaussian")

h2=formula(HumanDevelopmentIndex~Functioningofgovernment + Politicalparticipation)
regre2=glm(h2,data=mergedData,family = "gaussian")
```

```{r regs1,results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# prepare labels

newCoefNames=c('(Intercept)' = 'Constant',
               "Functioningofgovernment"="Bureaucracy",
               "Politicalparticipation"="Participation")

## show result of both
library(modelsummary)
models=list(regre1,regre2)
modelsummary(models, 
             title = "Models for HDI",
             stars = TRUE,
             output = "kableExtra",
             coef_rename =newCoefNames)
```

I hope you like what you see in the Table \@ref(tab:regs1). You can learn more on regression in other book [@petrie_introduction_2016,150-160].

```{r collecting-DataMap, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

# github link to data:
linkRepo="data/raw/master/"
file_Name2="MapSeattle.geojson"
file_Name3="calls911_geo.geojson"

link_file_Name2=paste0(linkOrg,linkRepo,file_Name2)
link_file_Name3=paste0(linkOrg,linkRepo,file_Name3)

```

```{r plot-cityMap, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot numeric colums",message=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cityMap) +geom_sf(aes(fill=ACRES_TOTAL))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-cityMap) uses only one layer. Let's add another layer in the next map. Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it. It has been a very hard work.Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it. It has been a very hard work.Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it.

```{r plot-911Map, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Calls to 911 by time of day",message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
base=ggplot(cityMap) + geom_sf() + theme_light()
eventsByTime=base + geom_sf(data = eventsLocations,
                         size=0.5,
                         aes(color=nightTime)) 
eventsByTime
```

You can see that Figure \@ref(fig:plot-911Map) actually uses one map on top of the other. Let me show you an interactive version:

```{r plot-911Map-leaflet, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A map using leaflet",message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
# create palette for two colors
pal <- colorFactor(c("navy", "red"), domain = c(T, F))


leaflet(eventsLocations) %>% addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    radius = ~ifelse(nightTime == T, 3, 2),
    color = ~pal(nightTime),
    stroke = F, # border
    fillOpacity = 0.5
  )
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-911Map-leaflet) above looks nice. Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it. It has been a very hard work.Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it. It has been a very hard work.Here, I continue doing this nice work, I hope you like it and read it.
